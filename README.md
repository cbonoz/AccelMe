AccelMe Android Wearable Application
===================================

Samples demonstrating how to create a basic Android Wearable/Mobile Integrated application. This demo was made for a short introduction presentation at UCLA.

This app creates a transparent activity that runs in the background on the watch, while information is still being delivered to the phone. This could also be extended on the phone to make post requests to your remote server. A common use case for wearables is having wearable sensors collect data in the background, without any display on the watch itself.
